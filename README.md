# Beatact-Revived

Beatact"Revived" - A complete refactor of Beatact.

Beatact was supposed to be a project aimed at liberizing ticket sales and whatnot. Unfortunately, I came up with the idea just before covid so it was 
prone to an early death. Prone it was and dead it is so feel free to take it and use it as you please. I won't post any wiki or documentation so
you'll have to figure out what I was doing in there by yourself. 

If you do use it for something, please let me know, I'm no longer invested in it. You might have to re-do the firebase functions for interacting with stripe and 
twillio. I lost the source code for that when I deleted the firebase project a while ago so ... yeah .

Stack: SwiftUI, Swift5, Firebase, Stripe, Twillio.
